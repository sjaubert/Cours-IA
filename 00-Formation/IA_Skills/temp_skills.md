Anthropics Skills for Claude.ai
Its a miracle anything actually works in production when you think about how weve been using AI.
This week, I found myself writing the same 800-character prompt for the fourth time  instructions on how to format our weekly engineering reports, which columns to prioritize, what tone to use, which metrics matter, and oh yeah, please follow our brand guidelines this time. Copy. Paste. Adjust. Regenerate. Rinse. Repeat.
And I had this sinking realization: were treating billion-parameter models like glorified search bars with amnesia.
Every time you open a fresh chat with Claude (or ChatGPT, or whatever your poison is), youre starting from scratch. The AI doesnt remember that you need Excel formulas in a specific format, or that your company uses Oxford commas religiously, or that ASAP in your organization actually means within 48 hours unless the building is on fire. You prompt. It generates. You correct. It apologizes. You re-prompt. And somewhere in this loop, you wonder if youve just hired an intern who needs daily re-onboarding.
Enter Anthropics new Skills feature  and this time, the hype might actually be justified.
The Problem Nobody Talks About: AI Has No Institutional Memory
Heres whats wild about the current state of AI assistants: theyre simultaneously incredibly powerful and frustratingly forgetful. Claude can explain quantum mechanics, write production-ready code, and analyze complex datasets. But ask it to remember that your team always structures PRD documents with Problem ? Solution ? Trade-offs ? Success Metrics and its like talking to someone with short-term memory loss.
This sounds fine until youre actually trying to use AI for real work.
Ill give you a concrete example from last month. Our finance team wanted Claude to help process quarterly spreadsheets  multi-tab Excel files with specific formulas, cross-references, and anomaly detection rules that took us years to standardize. The first time, I wrote a detailed 1,200-word prompt explaining everything. Worked beautifully. The next week? Started over. Wrote it again. Forgot to mention one edge case. Output was wrong. By week three, I had a Google Doc titled The Mega Finance Prompt that I was copying and pasting like some kind of prompt archaeologist.
The inefficiency was absurd. But more than that  it was fundamentally the wrong mental model.
We werent using AI as a team member. We were using it as a stateless function that needed its parameters passed in every single time. No onboarding. No learning. No institutional knowledge. Just pure, amnesiac computation.
And thats exactly the problem Anthropic is trying to solve with Skills.
What Claude Skills Actually Are (And Why The Implementation Is Clever)
Skills are deceptively simple in concept: theyre folders containing instructions, scripts, templates, and resources that Claude can load dynamically when it detects theyre relevant to your task.
Think of them as modular expertise packages. You create a Skill once  lets say Quarterly Business Review Generator  and pack it with:
1. Instructions (in a SKILL.md file): Use our standard QBR template. Highlight revenue, churn, and product adoption. Compare against last quarter. Flag anything that deviated more than 15%.
2. Templates: The actual PowerPoint or Word template your company uses
3. Scripts: Maybe some Python code to validate data formats or calculate specific metrics
4. Reference materials: Brand guidelines, previous QBR examples, glossaries of company-specific terms
Now heres where it gets interesting: Claude doesnt load all of this into context for every single conversation. That would be computationally insane and slow everything to a crawl.
Instead, Skills use a progressive disclosure model (yes, its as clever as it sounds). When you start a conversation, Claude only sees the metadata of all your installed Skills  like a table of contents. When you say something like Hey, generate this quarters business review from this spreadsheet, Claude scans those metadata entries, recognizes oh, theres a QBR Skill, and then loads only that Skills full contents.
This is genuinely smart engineering. You get the benefits of specialized, context-rich instructions without paying the latency and token cost of loading everything all the time. Its lazy loading for AI  and just like in software, its the right architectural choice.
Four Things That Make Skills Different From Just Better Prompting
1. Theyre Composable
This is the part that made me actually sit up and pay attention. Skills can stack.
Lets say you have three Skills:
* Brand Guidelines (tone, terminology, visual standards)
* Financial Reporting (how to structure finance documents)
* Excel Power User (complex spreadsheet operations with formulas)
You ask Claude: Take this raw financial data, clean it up, and create a branded one-pager summary.
Claude doesnt just pick one Skill. It recognizes that this task requires all three, loads them together, and coordinates their use automatically. Its applying your brand tone while following your finance structure while manipulating the spreadsheet properly. No manual now use this prompt, now use that prompt orchestration from you.
This is where Skills start feeling less like a feature and more like a paradigm shift. Youre not just getting better outputs  youre building a library of reusable expertise that compounds over time.
2. Theyre Portable (Actually Portable)
Build once, run anywhere is usually a lie. Remember Java applets? Yeah.
But Anthropic seems to have genuinely nailed this. A Skill uses the same format across:
* Claudes web interface (claude.ai)
* Claude Code (their VS Code-esque terminal tool)
* The API (for programmatic access)
* The Agent SDK (for building custom agents)
You write your Code Review Checklist Skill once, and it works whether youre chatting with Claude in a browser, asking it to review PRs in your terminal, or building an automated review bot via API. Same folder structure. Same SKILL.md file. Same resources.
This portability matters more than it might seem at first. It means your organizations knowledge doesnt get siloed into oh, this only works in the web app or this is API-only. Youre building a genuinely reusable asset.
3. They Can Include Executable Code
Heres something that separates Skills from fancy prompt engineering: they can execute actual code.
Why does this matter? Because there are some tasks where you absolutely do not want AI to generate tokens. You want deterministic computation.
Example: data validation. If youre checking that every row in a spreadsheet has a properly formatted email address, you dont want Claude to think creatively about what constitutes a valid email. You want it to run ^[a-zA-Z09._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z09.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$ and give you a yes/no answer.
Or consider date calculations, financial formulas, or file format conversions. These need to be correct, not creative. Skills can package Python scripts (or other code) that Claude executes in a secure sandboxed environment when appropriate.
This hybrid approach  letting Claude use its reasoning for nuanced decisions while falling back to code for deterministic operations  feels like the right balance. Its admitting that generative AI isnt always the best tool, and thats refreshing honesty in this space.
4. They Work Automatically
You dont manually select Skills.
This was my first question: Okay, so I have 30 Skills installed. Do I have to tell Claude which ones to use? Nope. Claude figures it out.
When you describe your task, Claude scans available Skills, evaluates relevance, and activates the ones it needs. You can even watch this happen in real-time  Claudes thinking stream will show you Using [Skill name] as it loads and applies them.
This removes cognitive overhead. You dont need to remember which Skill does what or manually orchestrate their use. You just describe your task in natural language, and the system handles the rest. Its the promise of abstraction: hide complexity without losing power.
Real-World Use Cases (That Actually Make Sense)
Let me ground this with some concrete examples that arent just marketing fluff:
Finance and Accounting Operations
A mid-sized company I talked to is using a custom Skill for management accounting workflows. They process multiple quarterly spreadsheets with specific anomaly detection rules (anything over 15% variance from forecast gets flagged), generate reports following their CFOs preferred structure, and apply consistent formatting.
Before Skills: this took a full business day per quarter, with multiple back-and-forth revisions.
After Skills: one hour. Same quality. No re-explaining the process each time.
The Skill includes their validation rules as executable Python, their report template as a resource file, and detailed instructions on tone and structure in the SKILL.md. Claude runs the code to catch anomalies, applies the template, and generates the narrative report  all in one go.
Developer Workflows in Claude Code
Heres one Im personally excited about: repository scaffolding and code review automation.
Imagine youre starting a new microservice. You have opinions (strong ones) about project structure: where config files go, how to name modules, what your test directory should look like, which linting rules to enforce, how to structure Docker files.
Create a Repo Scaffold Skill once. Pack it with your templated directory structure, a script to set up pre-commit hooks, your preferred .gitignore, and instructions on coding standards.
Now, in Claude Code, you just say: Set up a new Python API service. Claude recognizes the Skill, executes the scaffolding script, generates the boilerplate following your structure, and even initializes version control with your standard hooks.
Same for code review. Build a PR Review Checklist Skill with your teams standards (test coverage thresholds, documentation requirements, security checks). When reviewing PRs, Claude automatically applies these criteria.
Content Creation with Brand Consistency
This ones huge for marketing and content teams. You have brand guidelines: specific terminology (customers not users), tone (conversational but professional), structure (hook ? problem ? solution ? CTA), and visual standards.
Package these as a Brand Voice Skill. Now every time anyone on your team asks Claude to draft something  blog posts, social media, email campaigns, landing pages  it automatically applies your brand standards.
No more heres our 47-page brand guide, please follow it prompts. No more inconsistency across team members. The Skill encodes your standards once, and everyone gets brand-compliant outputs by default.
Integration-Specific Workflows
Several platforms are already building Skills for their ecosystems:
* Box created a Skill for transforming stored documents into presentations, spreadsheets, and Word docs following organizational standards
* Notion built a Skill to streamline question-to-action workflows within their platform
* Canva is leveraging Skills to customize design agents
These arent generic integrations. Theyre packaging domain-specific expertise about how to properly work with these tools into reusable Skills.
How To Actually Create A Skill (Its Easier Than You Think)
Heres the part that surprised me: you dont need to be a developer or understand some complex specification to create Skills.
Anthropic built a skill-creator Skill (yes, thats meta, but stay with me). Heres the actual workflow:
Step 1: Enable Skills
Go to Settings in Claude, enable the Skills capability.
Step 2: Start A Conversation
Open a new chat and say something like: I want to create a Skill for quarterly business reviews or I need a Skill that knows how to analyze customer feedback data.
Step 3: Provide Context
Upload any materials that show your approach: templates you already use, examples of good work, brand guidelines, data files you reference. Or just describe your process verbally.
Step 4: Answer Questions
Claude will interview you about your workflow. It asks things like:
* Can you give examples of when youd use this Skill?
* What makes output good for this type of work?
* Are there specific tools or data formats involved?
Be specific enough that someone capable but unfamiliar could follow your approach.
Step 5: Claude Builds It
As you explain, Claude generates the SKILL.md file, organizes your materials, writes any necessary scripts, and packages everything into a ZIP file.
Step 6: Install and Test
Download the ZIP, upload it in Settings > Capabilities > Skills, and your Skill is active.
Start a new conversation where this Skill should apply. Youll see Using [skill name] in Claudes thinking if it recognizes the situation. If somethings off, go back to your creation conversation, tell Claude what to adjust, and itll revise the Skill.
This conversational approach to Skill creation is genuinely clever. Instead of forcing users to learn some YAML specification or file format, you just explain what you need and Claude figures out how to encode it.
The Technical Architecture (For Those Who Care)
If youre wondering but how does this actually work under the hood, heres what Ive pieced together:
Progressive Metadata Loading
When Claude starts a session with Skills enabled, it first loads only the metadata: Skill names, brief descriptions, trigger keywords. This is lightweight  maybe a few hundred tokens total even with dozens of Skills installed.
When you describe your task, Claude evaluates this metadata using its reasoning capabilities to determine relevance. If it detects a match (probably using some semantic similarity threshold), it loads the full Skill contents  the SKILL.md instructions, resources, scripts.
This lazy-loading pattern keeps latency low and context windows manageable.
Secure Code Execution Environment
For Skills that include executable code, Claude uses the Code Execution Tool beta  a sandboxed environment where scripts can run without accessing your broader filesystem or network (unless explicitly permitted and approved).
This is critical for security. You dont want some random Skill from the internet having access to your entire file system. The sandbox prevents most malicious behavior while still allowing legitimate operations like reading uploaded files or writing output documents.
Composability Through Context Merging
When multiple Skills are active, Claude merges their instructions into a unified context. Theres probably some hierarchical prompting happening here: base instructions from Claudes system prompt, then Skill-specific instructions layered on top, with conflict resolution rules (later Skills probably override earlier ones for conflicting guidance).
The fact that this works automatically suggests some sophisticated prompt engineering and instruction parsing behind the scenes.
Portability Via Standardized Format
All Skills follow a consistent structure: a SKILL.md file (likely with specific sections that Claude knows how to parse), an optional resources folder, and metadata in a predictable format.
This standardization is what enables portability. Whether youre using Skills via API, in Claude Code, or in the web app, the underlying system knows how to read this format and behave accordingly.
What Makes This Different From Previous Attempts
If youve been around the AI space for a while, you might be thinking: Wait, havent we seen this before? Custom instructions? System prompts? GPTs? Plugins?
Fair question. Lets distinguish:
vs. Custom Instructions
Custom instructions (like ChatGPTs feature) apply globally to every conversation. Theyre always loaded, always active.
Skills are contextual and modular. They only load when relevant, and you can have dozens without context bloat. Plus, Skills can include executable code and structured resources, not just text instructions.
vs. System Prompts (for developers)
System prompts via API are monolithic. You write one big prompt that covers everything you want the AI to do.
Skills are composable. You build a library of specialized capabilities that activate and combine dynamically. Its the difference between one giant function and a well-organized codebase with modular components.
vs. OpenAI GPTs
GPTs are siloed conversational interfaces. Each GPT is its own separate chat endpoint with baked-in instructions.
Skills work within Claude across all surfaces. Youre not creating separate AIs  youre augmenting one unified Claude with dynamic expertise. And Skills are portable to code environments and APIs, not just chat.
vs. Plugins
Plugins (in ChatGPTs original design) were external API calls  letting the AI fetch data from outside services.
Skills are internal capability enhancements. They teach Claude how to do things rather than giving it access to external data sources. (Though Anthropic also has MCP  Model Context Protocol  for external integrations, which is separate from Skills).
The key insight: Skills are about encoding process knowledge, not just connecting to external tools or providing static instructions.
The Limitations Nobodys Talking About (Yet)
Okay, lets pump the brakes on the hype train for a second and talk about whats not clear or potentially problematic:
1. Skill Discovery and Organization
What happens when you have 50 Skills installed? 100? How do you organize them? Is there tagging, categorization, or search? The documentation doesnt say much here, and I can easily see Skill sprawl becoming an issue.
Without proper tooling, you might end up with a chaotic library of Skills where nobody remembers what QBR_v3_final_FINAL actually does.
2. Version Control and Collaboration
For team/enterprise use, how do you manage Skill versions? If I update a Skill, does it affect everyone immediately? Is there rollback? Can different team members use different versions?
Anthropic mentions working toward simplified skill creation workflows and enterprise-wide deployment capabilities in their announcement, which suggests this isnt fully baked yet.
3. Security and Trust
This is the big one. Skills can execute code.
Anthropic warns: this feature gives Claude access to execute code. While powerful, it means being mindful about which skills you use  stick to trusted sources to keep your data safe.
But what does trusted sources mean in practice? Is there a Skills marketplace? How do you audit a Skill before installing it? Can you review the code? Is there sandboxing that prevents truly malicious behavior?
The potential for supply chain attacks here is real. Imagine downloading a Helpful Spreadsheet Analyzer Skill that includes a script exfiltrating your data.
4. Performance and Latency
While the progressive loading is smart, theres still overhead. Every Skill check requires reasoning cycles (Is this Skill relevant?), and loading full Skills adds latency.
For API use cases where youre making hundreds of requests per minute, this could add up. Anthropic claims its efficient, but real-world benchmarks will tell.
5. Cost Implications
Skills use tokens  both for the metadata scanning and for loading full instructions. If youre on a token-based pricing model via API, running multiple complex Skills could meaningfully increase costs.
Anthropic hasnt published clear guidance on token costs for Skills yet. This needs transparency before enterprise adoption at scale.
Where This Goes Next (And Why It Matters)
Heres my hot take: Skills might be more important than Model Context Protocol (MCP), and possibly more transformative than incremental model improvements.
Why? Because the limiting factor for AI usefulness isnt usually raw intelligence anymore  its specificity and repeatability.
Claude is already smart enough to write code, analyze data, and generate content. The problem is making it do these things your way, consistently, without re-explaining yourself every time.
Skills solve the last mile problem of AI deployment: customization and institutionalization.
What Im Watching For:
1. Skills Marketplaces: Will there be a community repository of Skills (like VSCode extensions or npm packages)? Anthropic has a GitHub repo of example Skills, but a full ecosystem with ratings, reviews, and curation would be transformative.
2. Enterprise Management Tools: Version control, access control, analytics on Skill usage, centralized deployment  the DevOps for Skills tooling.
3. Cross-Provider Standards: Will OpenAI, Google, or others adopt similar patterns? Could Skills become a portable format across AI providers (unlikely, but one can dream)?
4. Dynamic Skill Generation: What if Claude could create ephemeral Skills during a conversation based on your feedback, refining them in real-time? Actually, let me teach you how we do this and boom, instant Skill.
5. Skill Composition Languages: Right now, Skills compose automatically through Claudes reasoning. But could we have explicit composition rules? Use Brand Skill + Finance Skill, but if they conflict, prioritize Brand?
The Broader Implications
Zoom out for a second. What Skills represent is a shift in how we think about AI customization.
Weve gone through a few phases:
Phase 1: Prompt Engineering  If I phrase this just right, Ill get the output I want
Phase 2: Fine-Tuning  Train a custom model on my data
Phase 3: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  Give the AI access to relevant documents during conversations
Phase 4: Skills  Package process knowledge into reusable, composable modules that activate contextually
Each phase hasnt replaced the previous one  theyre cumulative. But Skills hit a sweet spot:
* Easier than fine-tuning (no ML expertise required)
* More structured than prompt engineering (reusable, not one-off)
* More actionable than RAG (includes process logic, not just information)
* More flexible than custom models (update instantly, no retraining)
For organizations, this could be the unlock moment where AI goes from neat demo to actual productivity multiplier.
Instead of every employee figuring out their own prompts (leading to inconsistent outputs and wasted time), you build a company-wide Skills library. Sales has their Skills. Engineering has theirs. Finance has theirs. Theyre versioned, maintained, and improved over time  like internal software tools.
This is AI becoming institutionalized, and thats a big deal.
Final Thoughts: Should You Care?
If youre using Claude (or any AI assistant) for anything beyond casual queries, yes, you should absolutely care about Skills.
Heres the test: Are you copying and pasting the same instructions repeatedly? Do you have a master prompt document? Do you wish the AI would just remember how we do things? Then Skills are for you.
The potential productivity gains are real. Im seeing reports of tasks going from hours to minutes once people encode their workflows into Skills. Thats not marketing hype  thats the power of removing repetitive setup overhead.
But (and this is important) Skills are not magic. Theyre a better interface for customization. You still need to understand your own processes well enough to articulate them. Garbage in, garbage out still applies.
If you dont have clear, repeatable workflows, Skills wont save you. But if you do have processes that youre constantly re-explaining to Claude, packaging them as Skills is probably the smartest thing youll do this quarter.
Were still in the early days here. Skills just launched in mid-October 2025, and there are rough edges. But the core idea  making AI customization modular, portable, and composable  feels fundamentally right.
Its the difference between hiring an intern who forgets everything overnight and building an actual team member who learns your organizations way of working. And honestly, its about time.
Now if youll excuse me, I have about 15 repetitive workflows I need to turn into Skills before someone on my team asks me to write that same damn prompt again.
